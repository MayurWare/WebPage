            <h4>Netflix’s Co-Founder Has 5 Pieces of Advice For Aspiring Entrepreneurs</h4>
            <h5>By Omar Itani</h5>
            <h3>“Netflix sounded a little porny, but it was the best we could do.”</h3>
            <img src="./image5.jpeg" alt="The Pre-Product Startup and the FDA">
            <p>Those were the exact words Netflix’s Co-founder, Marc Randolph, used to answer the question of how
                they came up with the name Netflix.</p>
            <p>
                In a recent podcast interview with Mindvalley’s Vishen Lakhiani, Marc shared with us the story
                behind how Netflix went from concept to company.</p>
            <p>
                He traveled way back in time to when he and his eventual co-founder Reed Hastings would carpool in
                the Bay area and, every day, Marc would pitch Reed a new business idea. Some ideas were not so great
                — customized baseball bats and customized shampoo. Other ideas transformed into something much
                greater — Netflix.</p>
            <p>
                Marc Randolph was 38 years old when he started Netflix, but he had successfully launched over five
                ventures beforehand.</p>
            <p>
                Here are 5 pieces of advice from the co-founder of Netflix, a company founded in 1998, that is now
                generating over 20.16 billion USD in annual revenue.</p>
            <p><b>1. Start now and start small; never leave an idea in your head.</b></p>
            <p>
                There’s nothing more damaging to aspiring entrepreneurs than mere inaction. I can attest to this
                myself as I spent the entirety of my mid-twenties talking about starting a business, but I never
                did.</p>
            <p>
                In 2011, at a university competition, I delivered a two-minute elevator pitch about a food-delivery
                app, won second place, but I did nothing about it. All throughout my time working at Google, all I
                did with my close friends was entertain start-up ideas, but we never put them in action.</p>
            <p>
                That’s why, as soon as I resigned, my single top priority was to finally start a project on my own.
                And within one year of doing so, I witnessed the greatest professional and personal growth in my
                life.</p>
            <p>
                Here’s the single most important advice Marc Randolph has for you: Stop talking about your ideas or
                entertaining them in your head.</p>
            <p>
                Stop talking and start doing.</p>
            <h3>
                “You have to figure out how to quickly, easily, and cheaply get your idea out of your head and
                collide it with reality.”</h3>
            <p>Every idea you have in your head sounds like the next big thing. And the more you think about it, the
                bigger it becomes. But here’s a reality check: It isn’t. Your idea is incredibly flawed because it
                has yet to be subject to outside forces. It has yet to solve a person’s problem.</p>
            <p>
                So how do you start?</p>
            <p>
                In his chat with Vishen, Marc gives an example of a university student who once approached him with
                the idea to build a peer-to-peer clothing-rental business. His solution was quite simple.</p>
            <p>
                He asked her for a pen and a piece of paper and prepared a sign that read:</p>
            <h3>
                “Need to borrow clothes? Knock.”</h3>
            <p>
                He then told her to slap it on her dorm-room door and see what happens. Just by doing so, and within
                a few hours, she’ll be able to find out whether or not the idea is viable. If someone knocks, it is.
            </p>
            <p>How to apply this:</p>
            <p>
                Marc’s advice comes down to three simple steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Get your flawed idea out of your head and put it on paper. Your idea doesn't need to be viable,
                    as Marc explains, “it just needs to be something that stimulates what the problem is you’re
                    really trying to solve.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get over that fear that keeps you from starting. Here’s one small mental shift to help you do
                    so.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get busy testing your idea so you can figure out the flaws in it. Once your idea is in public,
                    as people engage with it, you begin to identify the flaws in it, which then allows you to
                    reflect, reformulate, and rebuild. So don’t get lost in the branding just yet, prioritize
                    shipping your product so you can further explore the validity of the problem it solves.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>“It’s a way to get started. If you’re waiting to hire someone, you’re wasting your time. If you’re
                waiting to complete some education, you’re wasting your time. If you’re waiting to raise money,
                you’re wasting your time. Start!”</p>
            <p>
                Your objective is to learn how people will engage with your idea to determine whether your core
                concept is viable. And you only learn so by testing it.</p>
            <p><b>2. The magic lies not in the idea, it lies in the testing process.</b></p>
            <p>
                This second lesson is the reason why Marc’s number one piece of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is
                to just start; because once you do, you’ll come to realize that the magic does not lie in your idea,
                it lies in your testing process.</p>
            <p>
                “It’s not about having good ideas. It’s about the system, the process, and culture for testing lots
                of bad ones.”
                Implementation is everything.</p>
            <p>
                That’s exactly why James Clear has become so famous for saying that “you do not rise to the level of
                your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Likewise, in entrepreneurship, you do not rise
                to the level of your ideas, you fall to the level of your systems.</p>
            <p>
                This is another lesson I learned in my first year of entrepreneurship: You’re only as good as your
                systems and processes. And that’s exactly why in my second venture of building a writing business,
                the first thing I did was build myself a writing system that would allow me to rise to the level of
                my goals.</p>
            <p>
                How to apply this:</p>
            <p>
                In a fast-moving world, you need to move faster.</p>
            <p>
                Find a cheap, quick, and clever way to build systems that would allow you to continually test and
                retest your ideas. As Marc explains: “The trick is not having the idea. The trick is how quickly and
                how cheaply and how easily and how cleverly you can figure out a way to take an idea and test it.”

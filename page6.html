            <h4>Don’t become an entrepreneur</h4>
            <h5>By Aytekin Tank</h5>
            <p><span class='upper-letter s'>S</span>arah has worked at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Guardian
                    Technologies</em> for nearly a decade now. She started out her career at the company as an
                entry-level sales associate and has since worked her way up to a sales executive.</p>



            <p>She makes well over $100,000 a year, loves her team, her company and her life as a whole.</p>



            <p>When her more entrepreneurial friends poke fun at her for being a “nine-to-fiver” or “not dreaming
                big enough” she doesn’t mind. In fact, she finds it amusing.</p>



            <p>She deeply respects her friend’s drive to build the next Apple or Facebook… but she couldn’t be
                happier with her job and her life.</p>



            <p>She gets nights and weekends off as she watches her friends spend most of their “free time” working.
            </p>



            <p>During her late twenties, she has been able to cross countless destinations off her travel bucket
                list with a hefty 4-weeks worth of vacation each year, while her friends have been locked up in
                their apartments building and rebuilding and then rebuilding some more after that.</p>



            <p>Not to mention… when she hits her bonuses… she makes more than them combined. <em>But, who is
                    counting?</em></p>



            <h3><strong>Let’s have a candid conversation about entrepreneurship vs. “employee-ship”.</strong></h3>



            <p>I want to begin by saying the dream to become an entrepreneur isn’t a silly one… not in the least.
            </p>



            <p>After all, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/being-successful-by-not-following-your-dreams/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I chose that path for myself</a> and that decision has
                allowed me to build <a href="https://www.jotform.com" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener">JotForm</a> to almost 4 million users over the last 12 years… and it
                has given me the chance to work <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/attract-talent-build-culture/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a team of incredible people</a>… <strong>a team
                    of incredible <em>employees</em></strong>.</p>



            <p>However, I would be remiss if I didn’t say the dream to become an “employee” isn’t a silly one
                either. In fact, there is a great deal of me that would argue it’s a better one for some people.</p>

            <p><strong>Unfortunately, in the twenty-first century, “<em>employee-ship</em>”</strong> seemed to have
                gotten a bad rap, all of a sudden being a “9–5&#8217;er” became uncool… that aspiring to work for a
                company versus build one of your own somehow makes you small-minded, unmotivated or a follower. I
                totally disagree.</p>



            <p>The story about Sarah above (her name and the companies name have been changed for privacy purposes)
                highlights some of the benefits employees get to enjoy that most entrepreneurs don’t… until they
                “make it” (or <strong><em>if</em></strong> they ever make it).</p>



            <p>While I’m not naive to think that Sarah’s experience is every employee’s experience, hitting a home
                run and selling your company for a billion dollars isn’t every entrepreneur’s experience either — <a

            <p>We need to talk more about <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/disease-of-more/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener">the real cost of entrepreneurship</a> and our worrying “<a

            <h3><strong>Entrepreneurship doesn’t always lead to happiness, flexibility, wealth and
                    notoriety.</strong></h3>



            <div class="wp-block-image">
                <figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy"

            <p>“I’ll be happy when”… is a thought that has ironically caused much unhappiness for men and women
                chasing anything in this world.</p>



            <p>We find ourselves running after something — marriage, kids, a bigger house, a nicer car — and when we
                finally catch the thing we’re chasing, we find ourselves still feeling a bit empty.</p>



            <p>In psychology, this concept is called “<a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-focusing-illusion/"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">focusing illusion</a>”, it’s a cognitive bias where people
                place too
                much emphasis on a future event and as a result inaccurately predict the reality of the event.</p>



            <p>Think about a time you’ve told yourself a story about a goal or dream you were going after and in
                your head it looked like a fairy tale… but once you actually achieved the goal or dream the reality
                was far less epic.</p>



            <p><em>That’s focusing illusion.</em></p>



            <p>In “<a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/setting-big-goals/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener">Why setting big goals can make you miserable</a>”, I explained it
                using the concept of “post-marathon syndrome”, a well-documented state of sadness, worthlessness and
                letdown. It’s a natural human reaction.</p>



            <p>Many aspiring entrepreneurs suffer from such a psychological phenomenon. They tell themselves stories
                of what life as an entrepreneur will be like… but once they actually live the life of an
                entrepreneur they discover the reality is anything but.</p>



            <p>Often times, these stories come in the form of “I’ll be happy when…”</p>



            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                <p><em>I’ll be happy when</em>… I start a business.</p>
            </blockquote>



            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                <p><em>I will be happy when</em>… I am making $100,000 a year from my business.</p>
            </blockquote>



            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                <p><em>I will be happy when</em>… I sell my business and become a milllionaire.</p>
            </blockquote>



            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                <p><em>I will be happy when</em>… [fill in the&nbsp;blank].</p>
            </blockquote>



            <p>One story aspiring entrepreneurs tell themselves is that they will be happy when they find some of
                the many myths associated with entrepreneurship — <em>flexibility, wealth, notoriety, etc.</em></p>



            <p>But, from my own experience as an entrepreneur, these illusions aren’t discovered or achieved through
                entrepreneurship:</p>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>I will be happy when I have more <em>Flexibility</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> — my
                    life hasn’t become more flexible after building JotForm (and it wasn’t <a
                        href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/hire-slowly-grow-slowly/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">anything close to flexible during the first ten or so years</a>
                    while building it). After 12 years, my responsibility today is only bigger… <a

            </ul>



            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                <p>If, as an entrepreneur, you’re working 40 hours a week and “worrying” an additional 40 hours
                    outside of work… is your life truly flexible?</p>
            </blockquote>



            <ul>
                <li><strong>I will be happy when I have greater <em>Wealth</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> — while
                    JotForm has been a modest success for myself and my team, for every modest entrepreneurial
                    success, <a href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/everything-learned-about-failure/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">there are thousands of failures</a>. And,
                    regardless of the Cinderella stories you hear in the media, the reality of entrepreneurial
                    failure is anything but a fairy tale. There’s nothing poetic about going tens of thousands of
                    dollars in debt because your dream didn’t take off. Where it concerns entrepreneurship, I would
                    argue that wealth isn’t something that should be expected… <em>I’d argue it’s a rare exception.
                    </em>In fact, <a href="https://www.sokanu.com/careers/entrepreneur/salary/" target="_blank"
                        rel="nofollow noopener">according to this study</a>, the average entrepreneur makes roughly
                    $5/ hour starting out and established entrepreneurs make $62/ hour. Yes, that’s good money, but
                    far from being a millionaire.</li>
                <li><strong>I will be happy when I have more <em>Notoriety</em> as an entrepreneur</strong> —
                    another misconception of entrepreneurship is that it leads to notoriety or fame. While yes, some
                    entrepreneurs like Musk and Zuckerberg are celebrated like rock stars, most of us go completely
                    unnoticed. Instead of trying to make it to a magazine cover, <a
                        href="https://www.jotform.com/blog/dominating-tech-news/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">I choose picking olives and spending quality time with my
                        family</a>.</li>
            </ul>



            <p>So, when you truly look at flexibility, wealth and notoriety… you realize that entrepreneurship isn’t
                necessarily the best path to take to achieve these things.</p>



            <p>Entrepreneurship isn’t for everyone. Just because it’s cool or you are born to become an entrepreneur
                doesn’t mean your friends should become one.</p>



            <p>If you want more flexibility, you might as well work for a remote-friendly company. If you seek
                wealth, you might as well make money working in real estate, sales or investment banking.</p>



            <p>While there’s nothing wrong with these things, they can’t necessarily be found through
                entrepreneurship… or at least it’s not the easiest path to find them.</p>

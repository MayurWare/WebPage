            <h4>Building for the future</h4>
            <h5>How Deryl McKissack, president and CEO of design and construction management firm McKissack &
                McKissack, is reimagining public and private spaces for the post–COVID-19 world.</h5>
                <img src="./image4.jpg" alt="The Pre-Product Startup and the FDA">
            <p>In the late 1990s, Deryl McKissack visited a high school in Washington, DC, to speak to the student
                body about her career. At the start of that decade, she had founded her architecture, engineering,
                and construction management firm in the U.S. capital, inspired by her family’s 115-year-old
                business. When she walked into one of the school’s restrooms after her talk, McKissack was struck by
                its deteriorated state. She thought about the young women walking through those doors every day and
                the effect these conditions could have on their self-confidence — and she realized her purpose as a
                leader was to improve lives through building and design.</p>
            <p>Today, as president and CEO, McKissack sits at the helm of a leading design and construction services
                group with US$30 million in annual revenue. McKissack & McKissack has offices in Baltimore, Chicago,
                DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Austin, with 150 employees managing $15 billion in construction
                projects and serving customers across the U.S. and around the globe. The firm, renowned for such
                landmark projects as the George H.W. Bush Library, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the
                National Museum of African American History and Culture, has been doing steady business during the
                pandemic as commercial and public organizations rethink buildings and infrastructure for the
                post-pandemic world.</p>
            <p>The challenges McKissack has faced as the founder of a minority-owned business have instilled an
                ingenuity and resilience that cascade through her company’s culture, and that have been critical in
                addressing the evolving needs of businesses and individuals for the physical spaces they inhabit.
                She sat down for a Zoom interview with strategy+business to discuss how McKissack & McKissack is
                adapting to the pandemic’s disruption both internally and as an industry leader.</p>
            <p><b>S+B: Your firm has a unique origin story. Can you tell us about that?</b></p>
            <p>
                <b>MCKISSACK:</b> My family’s history in America goes back to 1790, when my great-great-grandfather
                came
                here as a slave. He was a builder. He made bricks. He passed this trade down to my
                great-grandfather, who became a master carpenter, who passed his trade down to my grandfather. My
                grandfather and his brother started our family business in Tennessee in 1905, making us the oldest
                African-American architectural firm in the country. In 1922, they became the first licensed Black
                architects in the Southeast United States. But what put them on the map was the Tuskegee Air Force
                Base that they designed and built during World War II.
            </p>
            <p>I’m an identical twin, and one of three girls. From the age of 6, I remember going to the office with
                my twin sister. My father, a registered architect, would prop us up on the drawing boards. He taught
                us how to draw details, do schedules, use Leroy lettering [a mechanical lettering device], and make
                legends. He started using the designs we made by the age of 12 for his real work with customers.
                When we went to college, he met with the deans of the architecture and engineering schools to design
                a curriculum just for us, enabling us to graduate in both fields. The plan was that we would work in
                corporate America and bring the best practices back into the family business.</p>
            <p>But then it hit me that I wanted my own little red wagon. I just had this burning passion to see if I
                could do it. Could I start a company with $1,000? I’d never even written a business plan, so I
                bought a book on how to do it. Although this is my own company, I consider it an extension of my
                heritage. Design and architecture are in my blood.</p>
            <p><b>S+B: As the founder and CEO of your business, how do you view your purpose?</b></p>
            <p> <b>
                    MCKISSACK:</b> Our company’s mission has changed over the years. Initially, I felt if I just
                followed my ancestors’ approach to be a trustworthy partner who under-promised and over-delivered, I
                would be successful. But about 15 years into this business, I realized my purpose had to go beyond
                our own organization’s success.</p>
            <p>
                I remember touring a DC school — the city probably had one of the most dilapidated school systems in
                the country — and seeing the girls’ bathrooms, which were a mess. Half the toilets were off the
                wall. The privacy partitions were down. The mirrors were so foggy you could barely see yourself, and
                the lights were dim.</p>
            <p>
                At that time, we were working on some new prisons, which looked much better than these schools. I
                thought: How can wonderful women graduate with a sense of dignity and self-respect under these
                conditions? That’s when it hit me that our mission had to go beyond bricks and mortar. It had to be
                about enhancing lives through design and construction.</p>
            <p>
                Today, we have the largest K–12 construction management program in the country. Much of our mission
                involves making the structure of the buildings more sustainable, using metrics that tell us how much
                energy is being generated by the geothermal system, for example. These tools, which are visible to
                the students in these schools, are used as teaching opportunities, as educators incorporate the
                metrics into courses. We have heard that this has inspired some of them to pursue STEM or
                engineering careers. Some of the other program management work we are doing now involves COVID-19
                mitigation, including upgrading schools’ HVAC systems for better, safer air filtration.</p>
            <p><b>
                    S+B: Of all the challenges you’ve faced since starting your business, the COVID-19 crisis must
                    be like no other. How have the events of 2020 impacted your business and your industry?</b></p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    MCKISSACK:</b> Our industry has not been as badly impacted as others because early on,
                construction was deemed essential. Of course, restrictions have varied state by state, but our
                clients provided written statements that we were essential, enabling members of our construction
                teams to conduct business even as everyone else was sheltering in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ve been going full speed ahead. Our requests for proposals have increased sharply, and we now
                have more than 70 active projects, including three 2021 [presidential] inaugural viewing stands that
                cannot wait. Of course, some of our commercial office space projects have been put on hold.</p>
            <p><b>S+B: What is your company’s outlook for the next few years?</b></p>
            <p> <b>
                    MCKISSACK:</b> Our customer base is 50/50 government and private. A decade ago, 85 percent of
                our portfolio was government, with federal, state, and municipal projects. But our board pushed us
                to add more balance to our portfolio, which has greatly improved our outlook. Initially, I was
                concerned that the public projects would lag as a result of a reduced tax base, but the shortfall
                has been nowhere near as big as expected. Meanwhile, so many of the projects we are working on are
                massive, multiyear, and already funded.</p>
            <p>
                Some of our government clients are also seeing opportunities and want to accelerate the work.
                Airports, for example, are doing more infrastructure work, taking advantage of the relatively empty
                spaces. We’re going through a massive renovation at Reagan National Airport, and the low traffic has
                been a huge help.</p>
            <p>
                On the private side, business is also robust. We’re seeing continuous demand, particularly in the
                energy sector, so I’m very optimistic about our near and intermediate future. Energy companies make
                up about 50 percent of our commercial clients — and the need for reliable and safe energy continues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, we don’t know where the pandemic is going to go. We may all have to shut down. But even
                though the construction and design industries are usually not this insulated from downturns, as of
                now we’re a lifeline. We’re keeping the economy going. I haven’t seen any indication that this won’t
                remain the case. And the next administration will have to pass an infrastructure bill to put America
                back to work again, so we’ll be busy.</p>
            <p><b>S+B: How has COVID-19 impacted your approach to public spaces?</b></p>
            <p><b>
                    MCKISSACK:</b> Design and engineering are constantly evolving with the times. After 9/11, for
                example, we were focused on security. Some government buildings ended up looking like fortresses. As
                time went on, people realized they wanted the security, but they didn’t want to see it. So, we
                adapted, camouflaging bollards by embedding them into hillsides, for example. For the MLK Memorial,
                the bollards are benches. And we built a steel wall into ditches disguised by big grassy mounds, so
                nothing can get through.
            <p>
                In the same way, COVID-19 is going to influence the design world. I’m not yet sure what that looks
                like exactly. I know it involves spacing and touchless features. Workplace health, safety, and
                hygiene expertise will play a larger role in design. Public spaces are going to be a work in
                progress for some time. Spaces can’t be permanently reconfigured until we know more about COVID-19
                and we have a handle on the efficacy of treatments and vaccines. Federal guidelines aren’t even
                solid on this, and we’ll need to continue to make rigorous hazard assessments.</p>
            <p>
                Still, we know that offices will need better HVAC systems to increase airflow, and more square feet
                of personal space per individual. They will have more touchless technology, with more cordoning off
                using plexiglass barriers and physical distance. Break spaces, lunchrooms, and washrooms are hot
                zones that will require creative work-arounds. Restrooms will need occupant limits with sensor
                fixtures, including touchless sanitizers. Traffic flow will need to be marked off, and passageways
                widened. Doorknobs will need to be removed from executive offices.</p>
            <p>
                Even when we get a vaccine, the anxiety isn’t going away. I believe many of these measures will be
                permanent. Public health officials are speculating that COVID-19 will be endemic, with sporadic
                repeats thanks to globalization. Of course, we will have more elegant solutions for creating
                separation. I was recently on a panel for the Center for Innovation in the Design and Construction
                Industry, and the ideas were inspiring. We will be using drones for tasks like inspecting and
                documenting construction jobsites, so people won’t have to walk through them — especially when it is
                dangerous to do so. COVID-19 is causing a giant technological leapfrog into more futuristic spaces.
